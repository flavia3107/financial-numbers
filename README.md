# Frontend Take Home - Financial Numbers

This project is a small Angular application that will accept financial numbers and display them in full.

Examples of financial numbers in shorthand format and their base form:

- "250k" -> "250,000"
- "10m" -> "10,000,000"
- ".5b" -> "500,000,000"

This project will be implementing this functionality.

## Project Requirements

1. Create an input component and route on which the application will accept multiple shorthand format financial strings (such as "250k", "10m", or ".5b", referenced above).
   1. You may choose to accept the numbers in a single input field, multiple input fields, or any other reasonable method you prefer, but the data must be possible to collect in a single page visit.
2. Create an output component and route to display:
   1. Each number in full (e.g. "250,000", "10,000,000", "500,000,000"), in the order they were entered
   2. An average of all submitted numbers at the bottom
3. When the user has completed entering the shorthand numbers on the input component, they will need a way to route to the output component where the will see the results.

This project should be time boxed to 4 hours.
